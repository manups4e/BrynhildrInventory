# Utility Elements

This section contains helper utilites used in and that can be used outside of the Inventory system, including color definitions, enumerations, and color management tools and drawing functions.

{: .note}
You can use these utils as well if needed.  
They are excluded from the **escrowed** files since they were taken from [ScaleformUI](https://github.com/manups4e/ScaleformUI), courtesy of Manups4e. Thanks bud, you're awesome ðŸ’–
