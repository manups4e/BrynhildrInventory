# Brynhildr Inventory

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/inventory-main.png)

Brynhildr is a **3D holographic inventory system for FiveM** built using Scaleforms.
It provides a modular API in **Lua** for creating the inventory, its tabs, columns, grid items, panels, context menus, and instructional buttons.
The script contains every tool needed to make your own unique inventory, this way you can have multiple inventories and multiple tabs for each.

{: .note}
> Note: the actual 3D drawing of the Scaleform is **intentionally left out** of this API, so each developer can decide how to integrate it in their projects, check [How to Draw](./todraw.md) for some example of drawing.
